Introduction
############

MOTECH allows you to integrate with OpenMRS - an open source enterprise electronic medical record system platform.
This is done using the :std:ref:`OpenMRS-19 module <openmrs-module>`, that communicates with OpenMRS through its REST API and exposes
OSGi services which allow your implementation to easily integrate with OpenMRS. Refer to the module documentation for
information on using the API it exposes, this document will describe setting up integration between MOTECH and OpenMRS.

You can easily configure the OpenMRS-19 module to integrate with MOTECH, and then use its API to retrieve or manipulate data in OpenMRS.
MOTECH uses the REST API exposed by OpenMRS for integration and it will require HTTP access to OpenMRS and an account
with rights to the operations you wish to perform.

Take note that the module was written with OpenMRS 1.9 in mind, and we will use that version for reference in this tutorial.

###############
Getting OpenMRS
###############

If you plan on hosting an OpenMRS instance yourself, you can download it from the OpenMRS website.
Note that the MOTECH module was created and tested to work with version 1.9. You might encounter problems if choose
to use different OpenMRS versions. Use the links below to get OpenMRS:

* OpenMRS website: http://openmrs.org
* OpenMRS 1.9.7 download: http://sourceforge.net/projects/openmrs/files/releases/OpenMRS_1.9.7/

Refer to the OpenMRS documentation for installation instructions:
https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Installing+OpenMRS

Here is the simplest possible route of installing OpenMRS:

#. Install `Tomcat <http://tomcat.apache.org/>`_
#. Install `MySQL <http://www.mysql.com/>`_
#. In MySQL, create a database called **openmrs**
#. Place the OpenMRS war in the Tomcat webapps directory, making sure its name is **openmrs.war**
#. Start Tomcat
#. Go to http://localhost:8080/openmrs
#. Follow the installation wizard instructions

Again, refer to OpenMRS documentation for more details.


#################################
Configuring the OpenMRS-19 module
#################################

The MOTECH OpenMRS-19 module exposes a configuration file called openmrs.properties. This file is registered with the configuration
system. Based on what configuration mode the system is configured with, you can change the settings either by using the Admin UI(UI Mode) or
the file in the config file location(File Mode). You can modify this file through the UI by clicking Admin > Manage Modules > Click the gear icon on the right of the OpenMRS module.

.. image:: img/openmrs_modules_click_gear_screenshot.png

The default username and password match the defaults from OpenMRS(make sure that you change these in production environment).

The table below describes the properties declared in the file and their default values, that will work with a default localhost
OpenMRS installation. The openmrs.motechIdName setting needs to match an identifier type from OpenMRS. More information on creating
the identifier type in OpenMRS can be found in the :std:ref:`next section<create_id_type>`

.. note::

    The module must be restarted in order for configuration changes to take effect.

###########################################
Creating a MOTECH Identifier in OpenMRS 1.9
###########################################

In order to make the module work with OpenMRS, an identifier type that MOTECH will use for identifying patients must be created.
The name of that identified must match the value of the configuration variable **openmrs.motechIdName**. In order to define
the ID type, go to the Administration section of OpenMRS, then select **Manage Identifier Types** under the section **Patients**:

                :scale: 100 %
                :alt: OpenMRS Administration - select Manage Identifier Types
                :align: center

Next, select **Add Patient Identifier Type**:

                :alt: OpenMRS Patient Identifier Type Management
                :align: center

Finally, enter the details of the identifier type. The name must match the one in the **openmrs.motechIdName** setting
variable. You can specify the settings as you wish, note that for example making locations required or adding a regex format
for the identifier will restrict what values you can use. Refer to the OpenMRS documentation for more information.

##############################################
Installing Rest Web Services module in OpenMRS
##############################################

MOTECH communicates with the OpenMRS via REST, which means that the OpenMRS instance must have a Rest Web Services module
installed and activated. You can find the required module on the `OpenMRS modules website <https://modules.openmrs.org/#/show/153/webservices-rest>`_.
Pick the latest released version (2.9+) and download it. You can install the module using OpenMRS UI. Go
to Administration tab, and select Manage Modules.

        .. image:: img/openmrs_restmodule_1.png
                :scale: 100 %
                :alt: OpenMRS installing Rest module
                :align: center

You will see the Add or Upgrade Module button. Click it, then select the downloaded file under "Add module" and upload it.
The module will be installed and started. You can verify its status in the Manage Modules section.

        .. image:: img/openmrs_restmodule_2.png

                :alt: OpenMRS installing Rest module
                :align: center

You should now be able to use the OpenMRS-19 module. Refer to the module :std:ref:`documentation <openmrs-module>`
for usage instructions.

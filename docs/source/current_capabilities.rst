MOTECH's Current Capabilities
=============================
The latest version of MOTECH is 0.29.x. We recognize that open source projects rapidly develop with many contributors adding a piece at a time. This document focuses on the capabilities of MOTECH right now and will remain updated regardless of the current release. We're keeping a list of future features on `our roadmap <roadmap.html>`_ with a focus on delivering MOTECH 1.0.

Below is a list of features currently available in MOTECH:

- Administration
    - Manage modules through the user interface. MOTECH is a modular system that allows you to add specific features and connections through modules. Administrators are able to install, configure and manage modules through the user interface.
    - Role based access controls, audit logs, password requirements and many other security and auditing capabilities
    - Create user defined entities (MySQL database tables, lookups and relationships) through the user interface
- Tasks
    - Wire up events in MOTECH through the UI with the tasks module
    - The tasks module is the primary method to act on events in MOTECH. Each interaction raises an event in MOTECH which can trigger a task and perform a corresponding action.
    - Run tasks on a user defined schedule, configurable through the UI.
    - Interact with systems over intermittent internet connections:
        - Push button retries allow administrators to retry a task when they know the other system is available
        - Users are now able to define retry schedules. For example, if the system is down now, a user can try to retry it on 6, 12 and 24 hour increments.
- Interfaces
    - Web Browser
        - End users can directly interact with the MOTECH interface through a web browser
        - End users can collect form data in `Enketo <https://www.enketo.org/>`_, which posts to an xform based system (Ona.io, KoBo Toolbox or ODK Aggregate), which then forwards to MOTECH.
    - Commcare two-way integration
        - Configure multiple connections to Commcare projects
        - Receive and act on forwarded forms and cases from CommCare
        - Import historical forms
        - Connect to Commcare's data, fixture and location APIs to supplement tasks
        - Interact with supply quantities in CommCare supply
        - Create/Update case properties from MOTECH
        - Post forms from a MOTECH Task action to CommCare (currently support simple forms without logic)
    - Mobile Data Collection
        - Collect data on Android phones using ODK Collect, ODK Scan or Ona Collect. The data is forwarded from Ona.io, Kobo Toolbox or ODK Aggregate to MOTECH
    - SMS Integration
        - Send and receive SMS from MOTECH through integration with an SMS aggregater with predefined configurations for popular systems including:
            - `Clickatell <https://www.clickatell.com/>`_

        - Create encounters and observations
    - Perform Message Campaigns
        - MOTECH is able to perform SMS, voice and email message campaigns directly to communities and front line workers
    - Pill Reminder System
        - Enroll users in a custom pill regimen and send per-user reminders for their specific medication
    - mTraining (remote training over SMS/IVR)
        - Conduct structured courses through basic phones using SMS and IVR technologies

Major Changes

MDS REST API Generation

MDS CRUD Events

Other MDS Improvements

CouchDB Removal

Support for CouchDB, which was deprecated in version 0.24, has been completely removed in version 0.25. As part of the removal process, the development team extensively tested MDS performance to ensure that the migration to MDS had not introduced performance regressions in MOTECH modules.
